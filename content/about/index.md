Hi there! I'm Putri, an adult language educator with passion for civic engagement, education technology and UX/UI Design. I received my master degree in Educational Linguistics from University of Pennylvania Graduate School of Education, with a focus on second language development, universal design for learning, and technology.

I am passionate in facilitating adult learners to learn language skills they need to empower them. I taught at grassroots community-based programs such as Literacy Partners, RENEW, Moder Patsala and HIAS Pennsylvania to develop and teach ESL for refugees and immigrants language instruction. 

Few years ago, I worked at an ed-tech start-up, CoLearn, where I assisted in the development of online mobile apps delivering STEM courses for K1-K12 learners for almost three years. My passion in ed-tech does not stop in learning apps, I started a position as a Digital Humanities Project Management Assistant at Penn Price Lab in 2022, where I managed multiple projects and collaborated with the team to deployed scholarships project websites. My experience at Price Lab develops my interests in Project Management and UX/UI Design as a language educator.

If you're interested in booking an ESL Class with me or my other work, please feel free to see the price list [here](http://putriagustinos.com/). I also provide IDN - ENG / ENG - IDN translation for documents and abstract. My portfolio is coming soon.

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/agustinosputri).

Thanks for coming!
